# Arkanoid
“Arkanoid” Game Development – Object Oriented Programming Course. Final product of a 5-part-semester project in Java.

## About the Implementation Process
This project was coded as a five-part ongoing assignment on the 2nd semester of my 1st year at Bar-Ilan University.
The game enabled players to keep track of their high scores and persisted their current state and progress. Also, there are few level
strengths, and the levels designed using text files. The program parses the text files and implements the design indicated inside them.

## Technologies Included
• Developing in Java and using Eclipse as the IDE.
• Used Git for source control and Eclipse as the IDE.
• 2D GUI development in Java. 

## Compiling and Running
You must have Java SE 10 or higher installed on your machine.
You can download the added _Arkanoid.jar_ (located [here](https://github.com/matanmkl/Arkanoid/tree/master/out/artifacts/Arkanoid "This path skips through empty directories")). run it and play around :).
Also, you can download the entire source code and run the game via any Java IDEA, if you do be sure to also download the provided _biuoop-1.4.jar_ (located [here](https://github.com/matanmkl/Arkanoid/tree/master/BIU%20Stuff)).
